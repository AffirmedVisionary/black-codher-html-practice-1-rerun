  <p>Pascal is the wisest villager in New Horizons. Always wearing his stocking foot, which some may consider a swimming cap he can only be found at sea. Found being a strong word as he usually finds you as soon as you collect a scallop. Thinking about it, he is also smart. In return of you handing over the goods he gives you two pearls. One literal and the other usually very metaphoric but always wise. see below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some say you can only find him once a day</li>
    <li>The first few times you meet him he will give you a furniture item recipe</li>
    <li>The perfect camera angle and you can catch him giving himself joke and floating around</li>
  </ul>
